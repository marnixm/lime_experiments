To do:
- mention usefulness for accenture in conclusion
- Mention Parzen's high recall in two instances
- Parzen shows bad results with redundancy
- choose title page/abstract
- check references
- lime perturbations

- spelling:
less > fewer
amount > number
table, figure > Table, Figure
(in %)
explainabilty


Later:
- rename github page? lime_experiments --> ..?
  & improve readme file
- *LIME experiment* for original, *experiment* for improved
?? Check Parzen parameters & t-test
